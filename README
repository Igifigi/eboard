To run the 'eboard' app you need to:
1. Create eboard/localsettings.py and set:
- SECRET_KEY, DEBUG
- EMAIL_BACKEND, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- SITE_URL (the eboard site url; default: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000')
- MAIN_SITE_URL (the url of the company's main website)
- EMAIL_ADMIN
- DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
2. Customize your templates/home.html page with your own quick options and company logo.

Example:

SECRET_KEY = 'do-not-copy-this-key'
DEBUG = True/False
EMAIL_HOST = 'your.host.com'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True/False
EMAIL_PORT = 123
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'youremail@server.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
EMAIL_ADMIN = 'admin-email-address@mail.com'
SITE_URL = 'eboard.yourcompany.com'
MAIN_SITE_URL = 'https://yourcompany.com'
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'pl-pl'
